# Experiment log

| ID | Purpose | Command | Scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BASE-001 | Baseline data integrity | `python3 experiments/check_baseline.py` | Supplied 97-letter transcription and two crib intervals only | PASS: 97 letters; both crib intervals consistent |

Use [the template](templates/experiment.md) for future runs. Baseline validation
makes no statement about a cryptographic method or historical source accuracy.

## BASE-001 initialization run

- Date: 2026-10-18 UTC.
- Environment: Python 3.9.6; standard library only.
- Commands: as above and `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
- Result: baseline check PASS; all 6 unit tests PASS; exit status 0.
- Input: `data/k4.json`; ciphertext ASCII SHA-256 `eea813570c7f1fd3b34674e47b5c3da8948026f5cefee612a0b38ffaa515ceab`.
- Seed: not applicable; deterministic, one input, no search.
- Scope: data shape and indexing only; no cryptanalytic hypothesis tested.
- Code version: this scaffold commit (see Git history); no external dependencies.

## CTRL-001 — exact K1–K3 controls

- Date: 2026-10-18 UTC; deterministic, Python 3.9.6 standard library.
- Commands: `python3 experiments/check_controls.py > results/CTRL-001.json`
  and `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
- Input: `data/controls.json`; source provenance and disagreements in
  [verification](../sources/VERIFICATION.md). Literal expected plaintext fixtures.
- Parameters: KRYPTOS alphabet, K=0, modular addition, PALIMPSEST / ABSCISSA;
  question marks preserved without key advancement. K2 original and restored-S
  variants separate. K3 8×42 CW → 24×14 CW, row-major, 336 letters.
- Result: all four complete known-answer encrypt/decrypt comparisons PASS.
  All 15 tests PASS, including 120 seeded synthetic text/key round trips,
  independent opening vector, punctuation convention, and all 336 unique indices.
- RNG: Python `random.Random(20261018)` for unit controls only; no search.
- Runtime: under one second on the local Mac. No dependencies or network in checks.
- Scope: exact fixtures and stated conventions only. Images not independently
  transcribed; physical paper reconstruction not claimed. No K4 conclusion.
- Code/version: CTRL-001 milestone commit in history; output hashes in
  [results](../results/CTRL-001.json).

## STRUCT-001 — exact structural and encoding constraints

- Date: 2026-10-18 UTC; Python 3.9.6 standard library; under one second.
- Command: `python3 experiments/structural_checks.py > results/STRUCT-001.json`.
- Inputs: unchanged `data/k4.json`; no normalization, key search, or scoring.
- Parameters: all pairs of the 24 crib positions, periods 1–96 inclusive; literal
  letter counts; synthetic two-character codec inventory 0–47, no framing.
- Result: E deficit 3 required / 2 available; exactly 19 contradictory periods.
  Full witnesses and surviving periods in [result](../results/STRUCT-001.json);
  interpretation and prior-art limits in [findings](STRUCTURAL-FINDINGS.md).
- Validation: all 21 tests PASS, including both bijection directions and planted
  true-period controls for periods 1,2,7,8,10,21,42. Seed 20261018 for controls.
- Scope: no substitution-plus-transposition conclusion; no actual language
  converter; surviving constraints are not solutions. No novelty claim.
- Code/version: STRUCT-001 milestone commit in history.
